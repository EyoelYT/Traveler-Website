## Architecture

-   Compared to the express project, the angular project is way more
    modular and organized. Each module contains components that help in
    organizing the code in a more scalable manner. It gives an
    opportunity for the front end to be more reactive and engaging to
    the user. Angular also provides services that are used to handle
    data. They can be injected into the parts of the code where they are
    needed. Angular also provides a router that can be used to load the
    different components to display different views.
-   The Express server provides the APIs to the data store. It serves
    the HTML pages and templates that are rendered on the server.
-   The backend uses a MongoDB database in the backend because it has
    the ability to scale well and query quick. The document storage
    mechanism aligns very well with JSON formatting which makes it a
    great tool to use with web applications that use JSON like
    environment to store data.

## Functionality

-   JSON is a very lightweight format used to store data and bridge the
    gap between the frontend and backend parts of web applications.
    JavaScript on the other hand is a programming language that can be
    used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It can be
    used to manipulate web pages, perform asynchronous network tasks,
    and respond to user interaction.
-   JSON can be used both on the client and server side which makes it a
    common format for exchanging data across different layers of a web
    application. It also acts as a decoupled format (it has the ability
    to make frontend developers work independently of backend
    developers). Both sides agree on the JSON structure and can work in
    parallel without needing to worry about how the other side
    implements its logic.

## Testing

-   Most common HTTP methods include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The
    endpoints are how the client can communicate with the server using
    the HTTP methods. The security in this application consisted of
    authenticating a user and handing out a JWT token so that they could
    access some of the more restricted endpoints.

## Reflection

-   This project solidified my understanding of routers and endpoints
    (which I was lacking a bit previously). All my previous experience
    involved backends, so it was nice to learn a frontend framework like
    Angular. I plan to use this in my future projects.
